# Full-Stack FastAPI React Application

Welcome to the Full-Stack FastAPI React Application tutorial! In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through the process of building a modern web application using React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and SQLite as our database. The backend is supported by SQLAlchemy and Pydantic, ensuring a robust and efficient development experience.

## 1. Introduction

This tutorial is a step-by-step guide for building a full-stack web application using React and FastAPI. Whether you are an experienced FastAPI developer or a beginner, this guide will take you from the basics of HTML, CSS, and Python to creating a fully functional application with a beautiful and interactive user interface.

## 2. Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - Bootstrap for styling

- **Backend:**
  - FastAPI
  - SQLAlchemy
  - Pydantic

- **Database:**
  - SQLite

## 3. Getting Started

### 3.1 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js and npm
- Python (3.7 or later)
- pip (Python package installer)

### 3.2 Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fullstack-fastapi-react.git
cd fullstack-fastapi-react

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd ../backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Project Structure

- **frontend:** Contains the React application.
- **backend:** Houses the FastAPI backend code.
- **database:** Holds the SQLite database file.
- **api:** API models and endpoints.
- **app:** FastAPI application configuration.

## 5. Development Workflow

### 5.1 Frontend (React)

To start the React development server, run the following command in the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

This will launch the development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 5.2 Backend (FastAPI)

Run the FastAPI backend using the following commands in the `backend` directory:

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the FastAPI server at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## 6. Configuration

Customize the application settings and configurations in the respective configuration files:

- **frontend/.env:** Frontend environment variables.
- **backend/app/config.py:** Backend configuration settings.

## 7. Deployment

Follow the deployment guides for React and FastAPI to deploy your application for production use.

## 8. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during development or deployment, refer to the troubleshooting section in the documentation for solutions.

## 9. Contributing
